## Notes
- What is a data structure?
> A data structure is a way to organise data that it can be used effectively.

> Help to manage and organise data.

- Complexity Analysis
> **TIME** to finish & **SPACE** it needs

> Big-O Notation - gives upper bound of the complexity of the worst case, quantifying performance as the input becomes arbitrarily large.

- Big-O Notation

> Constant time: **0(1)**

> Log time: **O(log(n))**

> Linear time: **O(n)**

> Linearithmic time: **O(nlog(n))**

> Quadric time: **O(n2)**

> Cubic time: **O(n3)**

> Exponential time: **O(bn), b > 1**

> Factorial time: **O(n!)**
